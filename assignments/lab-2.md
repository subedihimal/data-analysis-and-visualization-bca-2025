# Lab 2: Seven Stages of Data Visualization

## Objective

Use the provided Jupyter notebook to explore and apply the **seven stages of visualization** as proposed by Ben Fry:

**Create a simple data visualization project** that demonstrates all seven stages of data visualization

1. Acquire
2. Parse
3. Filter
4. Mine
5. Represent
6. Refine
7. Interact

## Instructions

You must complete the following tasks:

### 1. **Acquire**

- Load a dataset from any public source (e.g., CSV, JSON, web API).
- Document where you acquired it and why itâ€™s relevant.

### 2. **Parse**

- Convert the raw data into a structured format (e.g., DataFrame).
- Show preprocessing steps (cleaning, type conversion, renaming columns, etc.).

### 3. **Filter**

- Reduce your dataset to focus on relevant features or categories.
- Justify why this filtering is necessary for your analysis.

### 4. **Mine**

- Identify patterns, statistics, or relationships.
- Use simple EDA (e.g., value counts, correlations, grouping).

### 5. **Represent**

- Create **at least 3 types of visualizations** to present your data.
  - Include one **bar or line chart**
  - Include one **heatmap or scatter plot**
  - Include one **custom/creative plot** of your choice

### 6. **Refine**

- Improve your visuals with color, labels, formatting, and layout.
- Apply best practices discussed in the notebook (e.g., colorblind-safe palettes, luminance contrast).

### 7. **Interact**

- Add basic interactivity (e.g., using `widgets`, `plotly`, or `interactive matplotlib`).
- Users should be able to explore different subsets or variables.
